        <p>
         Iâ€™m a dedicated <i><b>Full-Stack Software Engineer</b></i> with a strong foundation in both backend and frontend development. I specialize in building robust APIs and scalable systems using Node.js, MongoDB, PostgreSQL, GraphQL, NestJS, and Django, while currently expanding my knowledge in Spring Boot.

On the frontend, I enjoy creating clean, responsive, and interactive user interfaces using React, Next.js, Tailwind CSS, and TypeScript. Iâ€™m passionate about building full-featured applications that are not only functional under the hood but also intuitive and enjoyable to use.

While I lean toward backend architecture and data-driven systems, I equally value frontend craftsmanship and believe the best engineers can bridge both worlds. Iâ€™m also exploring the fields of  <i>Machine learning and AI</i>, aiming to eventually apply full-stack skills to intelligent systems.

Above all, Iâ€™m committed to continuous learning, writing clean code, and solving real-world problems through thoughtful, scalable solutions âœ¨ðŸ¦¾.
